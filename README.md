# Framebuffer demo

A simple interactive visual made with the framebuffer.

## Set up
Run
```
make
```
to compile the code.

To start the program, you must be in a nongraphical tty session. Run
```
sudo ./main
```

It is important to use sudo or else you will be stuck in graphics mode and will have to restart your
machine to bring back keyboard functionality. If all went well, you can press escape to exit the program.

## Controls

Use the arrow keys to move left and right. Press escape to exit the program.
